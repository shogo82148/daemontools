supervise monitors a service. It starts the service, restarts the
service if it dies, and maintains a one-line status report. The
companion svc program stops, pauses, or restarts the service on sysadmin
request.

cyclog writes a log to disk. It automatically synchronizes the log every
100KB (by default) to guarantee data integrity after a crash. It
automatically rotates the log to keep it below 1MB (by default). If the
disk fills up, cyclog pauses and then tries again, without losing any
data.

accustamp puts a precise timestamp on each line of input. The timestamp
is a numeric TAI timestamp with microsecond precision. The companion
tailocal program converts TAI timestamps to local time.

setuser runs a program under a user's uid and gid. Unlike su, setuser
does not gain privileges; it does not check passwords, and it cannot be
run except by root.
