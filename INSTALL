Like any other piece of software (and information generally),
daemontools comes with NO WARRANTY.


Things you have to decide before starting:

* Where programs will be installed, normally /usr/local/bin. To change
this directory, edit conf-bin now.

* Where man pages will be installed, normally /usr/local/man. To change
this directory, edit conf-man now.


How to install:

 1. Compile the programs:
       % make
 2. Create the formatted man pages, *.0:
       % make man
 3. Install the programs and man pages:
       # make setup


That's it! To report success:
       % ( echo 'First M. Last'; cat `cat SYSDEPS` ) \
         | mail djb-qst@koobera.math.uic.edu
Replace First M. Last with your name.
